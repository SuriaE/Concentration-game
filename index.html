      <p>Welcome to this page. Here you can find the memory game popularly known as Concentration game. This is a card game in which all of the cards are laid
        face down on a surface and two cards are flipped face up over each turn. The object of the game is to turn over pairs
        of matching cards. Concentration can be played with any number of players or as solitaire. It is a particularly good
        game for young children, though adults may find it challenging and stimulating as well.</p>
